Spring Boot "Microservice" Example Project

This is a sample Java / Maven / Spring Boot application that can be used as a starter for creating a REST API.

The service is just a simple Restaurant management REST service. It uses MySQL database to store the data.

 You can call some REST endpoints 8080:
 localhost:8080/api/restaurants
 
 Running project with MySQL: I have attached 2 SQL files. Run those scripts before running the application.
